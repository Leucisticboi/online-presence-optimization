# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description
I refactored this website's code in the following ways:
1. I started by changing all of the original parent 'div' tags to semantic 'section' tags. I also changed the 'header' section class to the semantic 'header' tag with no class, along with changing the 'footer' div class to the semantic 'footer' tag with no class.
2. I changed the style.css selectors to select my new semantic HTML tags, then consolidated all redundant selectors into singular tags where necessary. 
3. I added alt descriptions to all of the images in the HTML file. 
4. I added comments to both the CSS and HTML files.
